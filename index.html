        <p>Nigeria is a vibrant and diverse country located in West Africa, often called the "Giant
            of Africa"
            because of its large population and economic influence. It is home to over 200 million
            people and
            more than 250 ethnic groups, with rich cultural traditions expressed through music, art,
            and
            festivals. Nigeria’s landscape ranges from tropical rainforests and savannas to the
            Niger River and
            coastal plains along the Atlantic Ocean. Known for its oil reserves, bustling cities
            like Lagos and
            Abuja, and globally celebrated figures in literature, film, and music. Nigeria blends
            deep history
            with modern dynamism, making it one of Africa’s most influential nations.</p>
